   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `__pin_data`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `HasPinData`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `pin_init` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: there is an associated function `__init_data` with a similar name
  --> src/lib.rs
