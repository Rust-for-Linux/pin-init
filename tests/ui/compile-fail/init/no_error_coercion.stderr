error[E0277]: `?` couldn't convert the error to `std::alloc::AllocError`

   | |______________________this can't be annotated with `?` because it has type `Result<_, Infallible>`
   |                        the trait `From<Infallible>` is not implemented for `std::alloc::AllocError`
   |
   = note: the question mark operation (`?`) implicitly performs a conversion on the error value using the `From` trait
   = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__init_internal` which comes from the expansion of the macro `try_init` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
